# Network Tools
An easily extendable program that allows for network analysis. Utilizes `libpcap`.
This could be illegal to run on networks you don't own. I am not responsible for anything people do with this software.
```
./networkTools [module] [options]
```

## Modules 
1. Dump - Dump all traffic through a selected device

I would've liked doing this in C but C++ makes it easier to make abstractable modules.
